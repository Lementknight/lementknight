# üëã Hi there, I'm Caleb Aguirre-Leon

## About Me

I am a site reliability engineer who strives to make systems that are reliable, maintainable, and scalable. I love being able to tackle problems that are daunting where solutions feel unfeasible. I attribute my ability to problem solve to my background in education, computer science, mathematics, and engineering.

**Recently:** Project Manager at Innovate Orange, leading a team of developers building production-ready Discord bots with Python, Discord.py, and Google Cloud Platform infrastructure. Conducting comprehensive PR reviews and providing mentorship to team members, resulting in 100% improvement in code quality and 80% increase in on-time deliveries.

**Previously:** Site Reliability Engineering Intern at **Google**, where I improved Monarch monitoring system release velocity through implementing granular software release freeze controls for Google's planet-scale infrastructure. I also developed automated configuration generation tooling in Go and Bazel, reducing manual overhead.

**Open Source Experience:** Production Engineering Fellow at **Meta/MLH Fellowship** and Quantum Software Intern at **IBM Quantum**, contributing to Qiskit's benchmarking suite and building Flask-based applications with comprehensive CI/CD pipelines.
